I am four hours into [Complete Intro to React, v5](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5). I will finish it tomorrow for sure. I am really enjoying it and React things are clicking! This is a teaching style that works for me. I'm impressed with the small details, I feel secure about what is being taught. It doesn't feel rushed.

It's been too long since I've worked on a project of my own. I will start one after I finish this intro to React.
