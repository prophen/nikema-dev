It's time to use this blog. I've been logging my #100DaysOfCode on Twitter. You can see my previous days [here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode%20%40dev_nikema%20&src=typed_query&f=live)

Today I finished the firebase functions portion of the Social Ape app and started on React. I'm super excited to jump back into React and learn Redux. So far the client app is very empty. Material UI has been installed and I have a working router.
