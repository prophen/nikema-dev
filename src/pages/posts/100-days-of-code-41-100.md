excerpt: >-
  I need to keep it short again today. I finished the Intro to React Course. I
  really enjoyed it and learned a lot. I'm looking forward to Intermediate React
  from the same instructor.I want to start building regularly. Set a goal for a
  complete project daily or maybe weekly to start. It's important to learn but
  also to apply what is learned. Building from scratch is just different than
  following a tutorial. https://github.com/prophen/complete-intro-to-react-v5
