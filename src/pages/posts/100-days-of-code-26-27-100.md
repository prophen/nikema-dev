Today, I took the technical screen for the Twilio Hatch Apprenticeship. Yesterday, I was working on figuring out a problem all day, I didn't touch the social network project. I was coding for hours I just didn't have the energy to write about it.

I added the signup page and AuthRoute to the social ape app. It saves the Auth token in local storage and redirects to the home page if the user is signed in and tries to access signup or login. Redux set up is next in the course and I'm so excited.
