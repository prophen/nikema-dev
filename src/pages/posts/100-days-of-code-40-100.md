  Another day of tired coding. I don't like that I waited until the end of the
  day to code, but at least I got some in. I'm tired. In the Intro to React
  course, I added a carousel to the pet details page and added error boundary
  middleware. I learned about the unary plus operator `+` it turns a string into
  a number, awesome!

Too tired. Hopefully tomorrow is a better energy day. 

I have the lowest morale today of all of my 14 days of job searching. Things still appear to be going well. My noes are starting to add up and I'm fine with that. I'm still applying to new opportunities every day. I know something will eventually come through.
