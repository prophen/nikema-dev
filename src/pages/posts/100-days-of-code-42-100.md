excerpt: >-
  Not much coding today. I was working on setting up my web server, a new email,
  and a WordPress site. I'm trying to get into these WebMentions. I think I'm
  there now. I will be testing with this post and my twitter post about day 42.
  It's after 3:00am my time. Way too late to be up messing with this stuff. I
  will be going to bed very soon.
