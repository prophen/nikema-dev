It's been a frustrating day of coding. I decided to go on HackerRank to familiarize myself with the platform. I have a fear of regular expressions. I worked on a couple of challenges using them. I solved one of them. Matching a string with the same vowel at the beginning and end of the string.

```
function regexVar() {
    /*
     * Declare a RegExp object variable named 're'
     * It must match a string that starts and ends with the same vowel (i.e., {a, e, i, o, u})
     */
    let re = /^([aeiou])(.*\1$)/
    
    /*
     * Do not remove the return statement
     */
    return re;
}
```

The react tutorial is not going smoothly. My results are not the same as what's showing in the video. I'm going to leave it alone for now. It's too late to worry about it. Gotta sleep.
