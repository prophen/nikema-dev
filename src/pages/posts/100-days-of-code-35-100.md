excerpt: >-
  I don't have my laptop with me and I feel so lost. I tried to get things set
  up on a desktop that I haven't used for coding in probably years. It didn't
  quite work for the social ape app. Instead of going a day without coding, I
  decided to work on the JavaScript track on exercism.io. I solved the Resistor
  Color Duo exercise. Just waiting for feedback now. There are 90 solutions
  ahead of mine in the JavaScript queue and 28 ahead in the Resistor Color Duo
  queue.
