This was my first build week project at Lambda School. As a UI Developer, I had the most junior role on the team. My job was to create a [landing page](https://empowered-conversation-np.netlify.com/np/index.html) and [about us page](https://empowered-conversation-np.netlify.com/np/about.html) that included reusable components including one written in vanilla Javascript.

I created this design and coded all the markup, stying, and JavaScript from scratch.
